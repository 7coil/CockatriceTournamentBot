            If a player is kicked the name that was sent to the API may be wrong
            it can up updated via the <a href="/api#%252Fapi%252Fupdateplayerinfo">../api/updateplayerinfo</a> endpoint.
            When a player is kicked it will tell you the names it was expecting,
            which can then be used to find the player name that was typed in wrongly.
            
            <h4>With Squire Bot...</h4>
            With Squire Bot you can use the command
            <blockquote>
            !tricebot-update-player "Tournament Name" "Match Number" "player name" "new player name"
            </blockquote>
            For example to change the name "Vldimir" to "Vladimir" in tournament
            "fnm-3/6", match 5, the command would be:            
            <blockquote>
            !tricebot-update-player fnm-3/6 5 Vldimir Vladimir
            </blockquote>
